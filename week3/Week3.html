      <h2>Exercise: Questions for chapter 7</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>Explain in your own words: What is the point of scales?
        <p>
            The scale is the mark of the axies. It is a translation of the value
            and their representation on the graph. The scale below is an actual
            function.
            <br>
            <pre>
              var scale = d3.scaleLinear()      //D3 linear scale function <br>
                            &nbsp .domain([0, 50])   //data unit <br>
                            &nbsp .range([100, 0])       //display unit <br>
              console.log(scale(50));  //returns display unit 0
            </pre>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          Why are d3.min() and d3.max() useful? And what's the accessor
          function? When do you need that?
          <p>
            <pre>
              var arrayNum = [3, 7, 9, 10]; //array declaration <br>
              d3.max(arrayNum);             //returns 10  <br>
              d3.min(arrayNumb);            //returns 3 <br>
              //accessor functions <br>
              var pairData = [[5, 20], [400, 500], [200, 100]]; // array of pairs <br>
              var xMax = d3.max(pairData, function(d) {         // d3.max() accessor function <br>
                return d[0];                                    // return max of first element among the array of pair <br>
              }                                                 <br>
            </pre>
            <p>
              The d3.max() or d3.min() is usefor for setting the x,y axis with out
              knowing the maximun or minimun value among large dataset.
            </p>
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>What is Bostock's margin convention mentioned on page 125?
        <p>
          1. The margin convention is to first setup the margins for top, right,
          bottom and left. <br>
          <pre>var margin = {top: 20, right: 10, bottom: 20, left: 10}; <br></pre>
       </p>
       <p>
         2. Then define graph width with actual display unit which substracted by the
         left and right margin. For the height, the display unit has to substract
         with top and bottom margin. <br>
         <pre>
           var width = 960 - margin.left - margin.right; <br>
           var height = 500 - margin.top - margin.bottom;  <br>
         </pre>
       </p>
       <p>
         3. Lastly, define the svg actual width, height and transform.  <br>
         <pre>
           var svg = d3.select("body").append("svg") <br>
           .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right) <br>
           .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom) <br>
           .append("g")  <br>
           .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")"); // to set where the svg locates.
         </pre>
       </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          Can you mention an example when you might need other scales than linear?
          <p>
              Other than linear scale, the scale I could think of are logarithmic
              scale: scalelog(), square root scale: scaleSqrt() and ordinal scale: scaleOrdinal().
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          How do you convert strings to Date objects? When is it good to check
          that your conversion works? Do you have to be extra careful with Danish
          dates? Why?
          <p>
             d3 converting string to dates
              <pre>
              var parseTime = d3.timePare(%m/%d/%y);  //returns month, date, year
              </pre>

      <h2>Exercise: Questions for chapter 8</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>
          Explain in your own words: What is the point of axes?
          <p>
              The point of axes(axis) in data visualization could be represent as
              reference line on a 2 diamentional graph such as x,y axis. <br>
              //Setting up axis
              Setting up axis needs to choose a axis style, for e.g. d3.axisBottom().
              Associates with the scale function then an axis is set up, for e.g.:
              <pre>
                  var xAxis = d3.axisBottom().scale(xScale)
              </pre>
              Finally, the axis need to be generated for svg graph by:
              <pre>
                  svg.append('g').call(xAxis);
              </pre>
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          On page 136-7, Scott notes: "You might be wondering why this looks
          so different from our friendly scale functions". Answer in your own
          words.
          <p>
            The reason for the difference compare to the friendly scale functions
            is, axis() function actually draw the axis based on the scale function.
            This is different then the scale() function. <br>
          </p>

          <p>
            So what does the code svg.append('g') do? 'g' stands for group element
            unlike other SVG 'circle' and 'rect' 'g' have is invisible by itself. <br>
          </p>

          <p>
            There are about two reasons to use svg.append('g'). The first one is
            to keep the code nice and tidy, the second is to apply transformation
            to the group which affects the visual elements with in the group. <br>
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          What are SVG transformations?
          <p>
              The SVG transformations can be perfomed by setting up the element's
              transform attribute. The transform attribute is allow to locate the SVG
              graph to a desired location on the webpage. The example can be found in
              <a href="#chp7">question 3</a> from chapter 7.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          Why might D3 give you different axes-ticks than you ask for?
          <p>
              Without any instruction of the tick format for the axis, D3 will exam
              the given scalse and make judgement itself about how many ticks would
              show on the axis.

      <h2>Exercise: Questions for chapter 9</h2>
      <ol>

      <li>
          Explain in your own words, what is an ordinal scale? When do you
          need it?
          <p>
            Ordinal scale is D3 scale function for scaling as given data in a sequence.
            It is espetially good at nonquantitative scaling.
          </p>
      </li>


      <li>
        If you were plotting data related to months (Jan, Feb, ... , Dec), would
        you use time-based scales or ordinal scales? Justify your answer.
        <p>
          <pre>
            var MONTH = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                        "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec" ];
          </pre>
          For showing monthly data, scaleOrdinal could be convient since it doesnt
          neccessary to be exact at which year and time.<br>
          scaleLinear:
          <pre>

          </pre>
          sclaOrdinal:
          <pre>
            var xScale = d3.scaleOrdinal()
                    		   .domain(MONTH)
                    		   .range([0, 400])

            console.log(xScale("Jan"))  // returns the diplay unit on the webpage for January
          </pre>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
          What is your favorite D3 transition?
          <p>
            easeLinear can do the job. But there are also other transitions for e.g. pure duration,
            easeCircleIn, easeElasticOut and easeBounceOut. <cite>IDV</cite> Transitions in chapter 9.

          4. Under what circumstances do you need to update your scale while doing
          transtions?

          <p>
            Whenever updating graph with new datasets, the maximum value of the new datasets could
            change either larger or smaller. When the new maximum value of the data sets is larger than old
            datasets, if the scale is not updated, then the graph could become strange. <cite>IDV</cite>
            Updating scales in chapter 9.

          5. Under what circumstances do you need to update your axes while doing
          transtions? What's the point of on()?
          <p>
            Whenever to update the graph with new datasets, since the value of the
            new datases could change, therefore the axes need to be updated as well.
            The point of on() function is to define the start or end of the transition.

          6. Can you think of a real-world situation where you might want to
          add/remove bars to/from your histogram?
          <p>
            To remove data bar might be perfomed as shift out the element is the dataset array.
            <pre>
              dataset.shift();  //
            </pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            To add data bar might be perfomed as add elemetn to the the dataset array.
            <pre>
              dataset.push(newNumber);
            </pre>
